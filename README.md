### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Daniel, a student of the Ekiti State Digital Academy (EDSA) anchored by Tech4Dev, Backend learning track. This is my end of the week assessment.

This JavaScript program calculates whether a person named Ivan, who inherited an amount of money and a time machine, has enough money to live without working until a specific year, inclusive. The program takes two inputs from the console: the amount of money inherited and the year until which Ivan has to live. The program calculates the expenses that Ivan will incur until the specified year based on the year's odd or even status and his age, which increases every odd year. The program then compares the total expenses with the amount of money inherited to determine if Ivan has enough money to survive until the specified year.
The program is implemented using the class and constructor constructs in JavaScript. The BackToThePast class is defined with two instance variables, money and year, which are initialized with the constructor. The calculateMoneyNeeded() method calculates the expenses that Ivan will incur using a for loop that iterates from the year 1800 to the specified year, inclusive. Within the loop, the year's odd or even status is used to determine the amount spent in that year. If the year is even, Ivan will spend $12,000; otherwise, he will spend $12,000 plus 50 times his age in that year, which is incremented for each odd year.
The if-else block compares the total expenses with the money inherited to determine if Ivan has enough money to survive. If the money inherited is greater than or equal to the total expenses, Ivan has enough money, and the program displays the money left after incurring all expenses. Otherwise, the program displays the money needed to survive until the specified year.
